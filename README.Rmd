-------
This package contains code that reproduces figures and analyses used in my MA thesis, _Improvement of epsilon-complexity estimation and an application to seizure prediction_.

The [`ecomplex`](https://github.com/nateaff/ecomplex) package contains the `R` version of the algorithm. Repositories for the three other packages used in this thesis, [`tssims`](https://github.com/nateaff/tssims), [`tsfeats`](https://github.com/nateaff/tsfeats), are also on github, [`tssegment](https://github.com/nateaff/tssegment).
