Title: Analyses for "Complexity-based seizure prediction" 
Version: 0.0.0.1
Authors@R: person("Nathanael", "Aff", email = "naff@mail.sfsu.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The package contains code to reproduce the analyses 
              supporting the thesis "Complexity-based" seizure 
              prediction. Intermediate data is saved in the cache file and can be reproduced by setting the 
              \code{use_cache} flags to FALSE. The raw EEG data 
              is not included but the derived feature data (will be) 
              included in the \code{inst\extdata} file.
