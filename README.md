This package contains code that reproduces figures and analyses used in my MA thesis, *Improvement of epsilon-complexity estimation and an application to seizure prediction*.

For an overview of the research see the [website](https://nateaff.github.io/eeg-complex/) that accompanies this repository.

The [`ecomplex`](https://github.com/nateaff/ecomplex) package contains the `R` version of the procedure for computing the epsilon-complexity of a single variable function.

Repositories for three other packages used in this thesis, [`tssims`](https://github.com/nateaff/tssims), [`tsfeats`](https://github.com/nateaff/tsfeats), are also on github, \[`tssegment](https://github.com/nateaff/tssegment). The first two packages unify access to a set of simulations and features, respectively. The`tssegment\` package provides an interface to the segmentation and classification methods used for predicting seizures.

The complete thesis can is [here.](https://github.com/nateaff/eeg-complex/blob/master/docs/thesis/thesis.pdf) This is the current draft as it hasn't yet been submitted.
